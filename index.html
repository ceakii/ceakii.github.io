            Hello! I'm Kaiden, a dedicated student studying Software Engineering at the 
            University of Texas at Dallas.
        </h1>

        <p>
            I have been interested in software development ever since I was a young child in 
            middle school. At that time, I built a 3D printer from a kit, and had a lot of 
            fun messing around with the software and observing how the 3D printer reacted 
            due to changes in its software. Ever since then, creating software that drives 
            all sorts of technology has been my biggest source of motivation in my career.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as C++, Java, and C. 
            I am also familiar with Python, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and SQL. As a student in my senior 
            year of college, I've taken a variety of courses all around the software domain 
            such as Intro to Artificial Intelligence, Intro to Machine Learning, 
            Human-Computer Interactions, and Computer Networks. While I enjoyed learning 
            each of these courses, I am still undecided about what I would like to 
            specialize in. Therefore, I am excited to explore more possibilities in the 
            working industry!
        </p>

        <p>Languages I am proficient in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>C</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Languages I am familiar with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>TypeScript</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
        </ul>
