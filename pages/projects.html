        <h1>Predicting Car Traffic using Linear Regression - September 2024</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a program in Python to predict car traffic using Linear Regression</li>
            <li>
                Learned how to pre-process a large dataset, create a Linear Regression model,
                and how to tune machine learning models to achieve optimal results
            </li>
            <li>
                Discovered at the end of this project that
                predicting car traffic using Linear Regression is not feasible
                since car traffic tends to fall under a non-linear prediction line
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Personal Portfolio Website - February 2024</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a website to host information about myself using HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Created a working tool bar and 3 pages of content</li>
            <li>Hosted on GitHub: ceakii.github.io</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Simple Computer System Simulation - September 2023</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a simulation of a simple computer system consisting of a CPU and 
                Memory using C programming</li>
            <li>Utilized Unix pipe and Unix fork methods to facilitate Inter-Process 
                Communication (IPC) between the simulated CPU and Memory processes</li>
            <li>Implemented a set of 30 unique instruction methods that the program 
                can interpret and execute, just like how a 
                real computer works</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>
            There are many other projects I've worked on during my previous school years that
            I will add later.<br> For Example:
        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Requirements Engineering project that includes creating:
                <ul>
                    <li>World Requirements Specification (WRS)</li>
                    <li>Vision Document</li>
                    <li>Powerpoint highlighting Requirements</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>AI project that solves basic Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)</li>
            <li>
                Computer Networks project that uses TCP to create a Client-Server program
                that allows clients to request the server to solve basic math problems
            </li>
            <li>
                Database project where we went through the process of creating a database
                for a college library system. (From Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to
                Relational Schema to SQL implementation)
            </li>
        </ul>
