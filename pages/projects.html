        <h1>Predicting Car Traffic using Linear Regression - September 2024</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed my first ML program in Python to try to predict car traffic using Linear Regression</li>
            <li>
                Learned how to pre-process a large dataset, create a Linear Regression model,
                and how to tune machine learning models to achieve optimal results
            </li>
            <li>
                Discovered at the end of this project that
                predicting car traffic using Linear Regression is not feasible
                since car traffic tends to fall under a non-linear prediction line
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Personal Portfolio Website - February 2024</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a website to host information about myself using HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Hosted on GitHub (This site): ceakii.github.io</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Simple Computer System Simulation - September 2023</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Developed a simulation of a simple computer system consisting of a CPU and 
                Memory using C programming
            </li>
            <li>
                Utilized Unix pipe and Unix fork methods to facilitate Inter-Process 
                Communication (IPC) between the simulated CPU and Memory processes
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented a set of 30 unique instruction methods that the program 
                can interpret and execute, just like how a 
                real computer works
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>
            There are many other projects I've worked on during my previous school years that
            I will add later.<br><br>Here are some of those projects:
        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Spring 2024</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Software Engineer Requirements Engineering</strong> project that included creating:
                        <ul>
                            <li>World Requirements Specification (WRS)</li>
                            <li>Vision Document</li>
                            <li>Powerpoint to showcase my ability in Requirements Gathering</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Intro to AI</strong> project that solves basic Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Computer Networks</strong> project that uses TCP to create a Client-Server program
                        that allows clients to request the server to solve basic math problems
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Fall 2023</li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Database Systems</strong> project where we went through the process of creating a database
                        for a college library system. (From Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to
                        Relational Schema to SQL implementation)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Software Engineer Architecture and Design</strong> project that involved gathering
                        requirements from stakeholders and designing an architecture that fits the
                        stakeholders' needs on documentation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Software Engineer Project Planning and Management</strong> project teaching us the basics
                        of project management
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        (Fall 2022) Basic AI game project played in the terminal where Ants try to move to spaces to
                        eat food and avoid Beetle objects trying to consume them.
                    </li>
