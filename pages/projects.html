        <h1>YummiGo React Web-App | September 2024 - December 2024</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>

        <h1>Predicting Car Traffic using Linear Regression | September 2024</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed my first ML program in Python to try to predict car traffic using Linear Regression</li>
            <li>
                Learned how to pre-process a large dataset, create a Linear Regression model,
                and how to tune machine learning models to achieve optimal results
            </li>
            <li>
                Discovered at the end of this project that
                predicting car traffic using Linear Regression is not feasible
                since car traffic tends to fall under a non-linear prediction line
                - Need a better model such as Neural Networks
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Personal Portfolio Website | February 2024</h1>
        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h1>Simple Computer System Simulation | September 2023</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Developed a simulation of a simple computer system consisting of a CPU and 
                Memory using C programming
            </li>
            <li>
                Utilized Unix pipe and Unix fork methods to facilitate Inter-Process 
                Communication (IPC) between the simulated CPU and Memory processes
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented a set of 30 unique instruction methods that the program 
                can interpret and execute, just like how a 
                real computer works
            </li>
        </ul>
